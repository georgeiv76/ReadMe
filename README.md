![Dedaub FAQ](https://dedlim.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2000/05/Linkedin-article-The-Role-of-a-Smart-Contract-Auditor-in-DeFi-Projects-Twitter-Post-2.jpg)

How long does a smart contract audit take?
------------------------------------------

A smart contract audit can take anywhere from **3 days to over 4 weeks**, depending on the scope and complexity of the code. Simpler contracts, such as ERC-20 tokens, are often reviewed within a week. More complex dApps or DeFi protocols can take multiple weeks to assess thoroughly.

**Key variables include:**

*   Size and complexity of the codebase
*   Type of protocol (token vs entire ecosystem)
*   Audit scope
*   Auditor team size and availability
*   Developer responsiveness during the process

### What are typical audit durations based on project type?

Different project types require different levels of scrutiny. Here's a rough breakdown of audit timelines based on common Web3 use cases:

*   **Basic ERC-20 token**: 3‚Äì5 days
*   **Mid-sized dApp with integrations**: 1‚Äì2 weeks
*   **Advanced DeFi protocol or upgradable system**: 3‚Äì4+ weeks

These ranges assume a dedicated team of experienced auditors following best-practice methodologies.

### What factors influence how long an audit takes?

The duration depends on more than just the volume of code. What matters most is how the protocol behaves, how its components interact, and what security guarantees it needs to offer.

**Main factors include:**

*   **Complexity** of control flow and logic
*   **Number of contracts** and upgradeability
*   **Use of external integrations** (e.g., oracles, AMMs)
*   **Availability of documentation and test coverage**
*   **How responsive the developers are** to questions and patch reviews

What is Dedaub‚Äôs audit methodology?
-----------------------------------

Dedaub uses a rigorous process designed to uncover vulnerabilities that both automated tools and casual reviews often miss. Audits are conducted by two senior researchers working in parallel.

**The process includes:**

*   **Phase A**: Understand how the protocol is supposed to work
*   **Phase B**: Break assumptions by thinking like an attacker
*   **Auditor dueling**: Reviewers challenge each other's findings
*   **Multilevel threat modeling**: Look for bugs that emerge from system interactions
*   **Advanced tooling**: 70+ static analyzers and custom fuzzing pipelines

What should I watch out for when choosing an auditor?
-----------------------------------------------------

Fast turnaround and low prices can be tempting, but rushed audits often miss deep, protocol-level vulnerabilities. Choosing the wrong partner can lead to costly security failures.

**Red flags to avoid:**

*   Audits promising ‚Äúdelivery in 24 hours‚Äù
*   Solo auditors for complex or high-value protocols
*   No retesting or fix-verification process
*   Vague, copy-pasted, or templated reports

Choose an audit team that explains its reasoning clearly, documents findings in detail, and provides retesting after fixes.

What is smart auditing?
-----------------------

**Smart auditing** refers to a more advanced, context-aware approach to security audits, especially in blockchain and smart contract environments. Unlike basic scans or static checks, smart auditing combines deep manual analysis with automated tools and attacker-level thinking. Here's how Dedaub defines and applies it:

**Not just a checklist. Not just a scan.**Smart auditing goes beyond surface-level pattern matching. At Dedaub, this includes:

*   **Two-phase review**: First, understanding the system like a developer. Then, attacking it like a hacker.
*   **Code dueling**: Auditors challenge each other to catch what the other might miss.
*   **Tool-enhanced precision**: Dozens of static analyses, fuzzing, and AI tools assist‚Äîbut don‚Äôt replace‚Äîhuman insight.
*   **System-level reasoning**: Thinking about how components interact, not just how they function in isolation.
*   **Gas cost and protocol integration checks**: Because inefficiency can be as damaging as insecurity.

In short, it's a methodical breakdown of logic, assumptions, and attack surfaces, guided by both human expertise and machine-scale audit methodology. üìñ Read more: [https://dedaub.com/blog/web3-audit-methodology/](https://dedaub.com/blog/web3-audit-methodology/)

How to audit a Solidity contract?
---------------------------------

Auditing a Solidity contract involves reviewing its code to identify vulnerabilities, verify correct logic, and prevent potential exploits. The process blends manual inspection with tool-assisted analysis to cover both design flaws and technical bugs. A proper audit focuses not only on individual functions but also on how the entire system behaves, especially under adverse conditions.

The audit typically unfolds in structured phases:

*   **Understand the system.** Before touching the code, auditors study the protocol‚Äôs design, its documentation, and intended use cases. The goal is to grasp the flow of value, user interactions, and security assumptions that underpin the smart contracts.
*   **Map the attack surface.** This involves identifying all external entry points‚Äîpublic or external functions, upgradable proxies, privileged roles‚Äîand checking how they interact with external systems (like oracles, AMMs, or tokens). Any component that can be manipulated from the outside becomes part of the threat model.
*   **Perform a manual code review.** Every line of code is carefully inspected. Auditors trace state changes, permissions, and dependencies while looking for common issues, such as reentrancy, unchecked external calls, incorrect math, and faulty access control. Each function is evaluated for its assumptions and edge cases.
*   **Switch to an attacker mindset.** Once the system is understood, auditors deliberately seek ways to exploit it. This means thinking like a malicious actor: chaining calls, manipulating control flow, using flash loans, or probing for inconsistencies between internal assumptions and external interactions.
*   **Use automated tools to scale the analysis.** Tools such as Slither, Echidna, and Dedaub‚Äôs Security Suite are used to perform static analysis, symbolic execution, and fuzzing. These tools help uncover subtle bugs and complement the manual effort, but they don‚Äôt replace it.
*   **Test and verify findings.** Suspected vulnerabilities are validated through test cases and simulations. This confirms exploitability and helps determine the severity and real-world impact of the issue.
*   **Deliver a structured report.** Every issue is thoroughly documented with a clear description, detailed reproduction steps, an impact analysis, and remediation guidance. Good reports also highlight positive findings, code quality observations, and gas optimizations.

Smart auditing is not about running a scanner and hoping for the best. It‚Äôs a layered process that depends on human expertise, adversarial reasoning, and advanced tooling‚Äîall aimed at catching what automated tools alone can‚Äôt.

What is smart contract security?
--------------------------------

Smart contract security ensures that blockchain-based code works safely and as intended‚Äîeven in adversarial conditions. Contracts, typically written in languages like Solidity, Rust, Move, Go (Golang), and Cairo, must function correctly and securely under all scenarios. Since smart contracts are immutable once deployed and often manage assets, any flaw in logic, access control, or integration can be catastrophic. Security in this context is about anticipating how a contract might be attacked, misused, or fail in edge cases, and taking proactive steps to mitigate those risks before deployment, as well as maintaining vigilance after deployment.

A comprehensive security posture combines **pre-deployment auditing**, **post-deployment monitoring**, and **operational hygiene**. While code vulnerabilities can drain funds instantly, many of the most considerable Web3 losses stem from compromised private keys or misused admin powers‚Äîfailures that go beyond the smart contract itself. Social engineering, phishing, and poor key management are often the actual entry points for attackers.

The discipline covers a broad range of activities and principles:

*   **Code correctness.** Ensuring the contract behaves as specified across all inputs and states.
*   **Access control.** Verifying that only authorized entities can perform sensitive operations, both at the contract and protocol governance level.
*   **Resistance to known exploits.** Defending against vulnerabilities like reentrancy, integer overflows, logic bugs, or oracle manipulation.
*   **Integration safety.** Auditing interactions with other contracts, protocols, or tokens to ensure assumptions hold under adversarial conditions.
*   **Gas efficiency and DoS prevention.** Minimizing resource costs while avoiding gas griefing or contract lockouts.
*   **Upgrade and governance safety.** Ensuring that contract upgrades, admin actions, and timelocks are adequately controlled and transparent.
*   **Smart contract monitoring.** Continuously tracking on-chain behavior to detect exploit attempts, deviations from expected logic, or protocol abuse. Monitoring is essential for rapid incident response once contracts are live.
*   **Anti-social engineering hygiene.** Enforcing multisig on privileged accounts, avoiding hardcoded private keys, training teams on phishing awareness, and using hardware wallets or secure enclaves to manage operational security.

Smart contract security is adversarial by design. It‚Äôs not just about correctness‚Äîit‚Äôs about outpacing the attacker. That means securing the code, the infrastructure, and the humans behind it.

How risky are smart contracts?¬†
-------------------------------

Smart contract risk depends on code quality, audit coverage, and operational practices. Most failures come from missing reviews, not the technology itself.

The most common risks stem from:

*   **Poorly written logic** that introduces edge-case vulnerabilities.
*   **Missing or broken access controls that expose administrative** functions.
*   **Unsafe integrations** with oracles, tokens, or third-party protocols.
*   **Human error**, including compromised private keys or faulty upgrades.

These risks compound quickly in DeFi, where contracts often hold millions in user funds. However, they‚Äôre not unavoidable.

To mitigate them:

*   **Audit every line of code** before deployment. Involve senior reviewers, simulate adversarial scenarios, and validate assumptions to ensure accuracy and reliability.
*   **Deploy monitoring** that continuously watches smart contracts for signs of attack or protocol deviations.
*   **Harden operations** with multisig wallets, secure key custody, and anti-phishing training.

Smart contracts are only as risky as the processes behind them. With the right audits and continuous monitoring, they become resilient, predictable infrastructure‚Äîeven in adversarial environments.

What are the vulnerabilities of smart contracts?
------------------------------------------------

Smart contracts are vulnerable to a wide range of risks, most of which arise from flawed assumptions, incorrect logic, or misuse of low-level EVM behavior. These vulnerabilities aren‚Äôt theoretical; they‚Äôve been exploited in real-world hacks, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in value being drained. Developers need to recognize the patterns and build with defensive assumptions.

According to [Dedaub‚Äôs guide on Solidity Security Vulnerabilities](https://dedaub.com/blog/solidity-security-vulnerabilities/), some of the most common classes include:

*   **Access Control Failures**Missing onlyOwner or similar checks lets attackers call privileged functions. This can allow them to change core parameters or hijack contract logic.
*   **Unchecked External Calls**Calling unknown or untrusted contracts without restrictions opens the door to malicious behavior. Developers should whitelist known, trusted contracts.
*   **Reentrancy Attacks**Malicious contracts can re-enter a vulnerable function before the state is updated. Use the checks-effects-interactions pattern to prevent recursive exploitation.
*   **Integer Overflow/Underflow**Arithmetic operations can wrap around if unchecked, leading to logic errors. Solidity 0.8+ helps, but unchecked blocks must be used carefully.
*   **Out-of-Gas Situations**Expensive loops or bad design can cause transactions to fail or be griefed. Use pull-based patterns and avoid unbounded iterations.
*   **Oracle Staleness and Manipulation**Relying on outdated or unreliable data from oracles can lead to contract breaches. Always validate feed freshness and avoid Automated Market Makers (AMMs) as primary sources of price information.

Most of these vulnerabilities are preventable. Awareness is the first step, followed by static analysis, fuzz testing, manual review, and real-time monitoring post-deployment. As Dedaub‚Äôs article emphasizes, even minor mistakes, such as using tx.origin for authentication, can escalate into massive exploits.

How much does a smart contract audit cost?
------------------------------------------

Smart contract audit costs vary widely depending on the complexity of the codebase, the protocol‚Äôs novelty, and the depth of the review required. There is no fixed price‚Äîcosts range from a few thousand dollars for basic contracts to hundreds of thousands for large-scale DeFi systems.

The main cost drivers are:

*   **Codebase size and scope.** More lines of code, contracts, or integrations require more auditor hours.
*   **Complexity and novelty.** New primitives, custom mechanisms, or unconventional architectures demand deeper review.
*   **Timeline and urgency.** Tight deadlines or last-minute requests can raise the cost due to resource prioritization.
*   **Reputation and thoroughness.** Established auditing firms with senior researchers charge more, but often deliver significantly higher value.

Ultimately, a good audit is an investment, not just in security, but in launch credibility and long-term resilience. Cutting corners here often comes at a higher cost later.

What‚Äôs the difference between an audit firm and automated code scanners?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Automated scanners help identify surface-level issues, such as common reentrancy patterns, unchecked return values, or unsafe math. They‚Äôre fast, cheap, and good for initial triage. But they‚Äôre limited. Scanners don‚Äôt understand intent. They can‚Äôt reason about protocol logic, economic incentives, or novel attack paths.

Audit firms, on the other hand, combine human expertise with tooling. Teams like Dedaub, Trail of Bits, and OpenZeppelin review every line of code with context: What‚Äôs the protocol supposed to do? Where could assumptions break down? How might an attacker chain interactions across contracts?

Unlike scanners, firms also simulate attacks, analyze integration risks, and provide detailed, actionable reports. Many use proprietary tools‚ÄîDedaub, for example, pairs expert manual auditing with a high-performance decompiler and a battery of static analyses designed for DeFi-scale complexity.

What vulnerabilities does Dedaub typically detect?
--------------------------------------------------

Dedaub focuses on deep, logic-level vulnerabilities that automated scanners often miss. The team combines manual expert auditing with advanced static analysis and proprietary value-flow techniques to uncover both well-known and protocol-specific issues. This approach isn‚Äôt theoretical‚Äîit‚Äôs based on uncovering real, high-impact bugs in production codebases. Examples from past audits include:

*   **Access control flaws** ‚Äì missing or misused permissions, such as onlyOwner, or entirely unchecked privileged functions.  
    **Reentrancy vulnerabilities** ‚Äì classic patterns as well as nuanced multi-function reentry risks.
*   **Unchecked external calls** ‚Äì use of call, delegatecall, or transfer without verifying success or target validity.
*   **Integer overflows/underflows** ‚Äì especially in unchecked math blocks or poorly handled token decimals.
*   **Denial of service (DoS)** ‚Äì logic bugs that allow griefing or stall the protocol under specific conditions.
*   **Flash loan exploits** ‚Äì systems that assume token balances or prices are stable within a block.
*   **Oracle manipulation** ‚Äì protocols that accept stale, zero, or manipulable data without validation.
*   **Upgradeability risks** ‚Äì flawed proxy patterns, uninitialized storage slots, or dangerous delegatecall.
*   **Economic attack surfaces** ‚Äì flaws in auction pricing, fee calculation, or liquidity incentives.
*   **Protocol-specific edge cases** ‚Äì issues that emerge only under real-world, adversarial behavior.

This approach enables Dedaub to detect complex security issues that require understanding protocol logic, not just code patterns. Real systems, real stakes, real bugs. That is what makes expert-level auditing essential. Source: https://dedaub.com/audits/

What is Dedaub‚Äôs approach to smart contract security?
-----------------------------------------------------

Dedaub approaches smart contract security with a rigorous, hands-on methodology that prioritizes deep understanding over checklists. Every audit is performed by at least two senior researchers, each of whom reviews 100% of the code. There‚Äôs no shortcut‚Äîauditors form a complete mental model of the system before trying to break it.

The process is structured around four core strategies:

*   **Two-phase review.** In Phase A, auditors analyze the code as intended, understanding its legitimate use cases and applications. In Phase B, they shift to an adversarial mindset, actively probing for vulnerabilities by subverting assumptions and testing edge behavior.
*   **Internal challenge.** Auditors do not just work in parallel‚Äîthey cross-examine each other‚Äôs understanding. If one claims to ‚Äúcover‚Äù a section, the other pushes them to explain its corner cases. This back-and-forth reveals blind spots and deepens insight.
*   **Thinking in systems.** Rather than isolating functions, auditors analyze how different parts of a protocol interact. Many real exploits emerge from subtle cross-module behaviors, not isolated bugs.
*   **Powered by advanced tools.** The code is run through the Dedaub Security Suite, featuring more than 70 static analyses, as well as AI and fuzzing.¬†

Beyond vulnerabilities, Dedaub also highlights gas inefficiencies, integration misalignments, and external dependencies‚Äîlike AMMs, oracles, or governance modules‚Äîthat may behave unexpectedly.

It‚Äôs not just about finding bugs. It‚Äôs about breaking assumptions, pressure-testing design, and delivering high-signal, human-validated insights. That‚Äôs the Dedaub approach.

Does Dedaub offer continuous security monitoring?
-------------------------------------------------

Yes. Dedaub provides real-time, protocol-specific monitoring to detect vulnerabilities, governance risks, and exploits before they escalate.

------------------------------

  
Smart contracts are generally transparent and public, although user identities behind contract interactions can remain pseudonymous.

How do I become a contract auditor?
-----------------------------------

Becoming a smart contract auditor involves gaining proficiency in blockchain technologies, mastering languages like Solidity, understanding cybersecurity principles, and acquiring experience through practice, certification, and professional engagements.

How do you do a smart contract audit?
-------------------------------------

A smart contract audit is a structured process used to assess the correctness, security, and reliability of blockchain-based code. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities, logic errors, and integration risks before deployment. Below is a breakdown of how professional auditors approach this task using established methodologies.

1.  Two-Phase Code Review

The audit begins with a comprehensive reading of the smart contract source code. In Phase One, the auditors aim to understand the code‚Äôs intended functionality, use cases, and invariants (conditions that must always hold true). In Phase Two, they adopt an adversarial mindset, attempting to break the contract‚Äôs assumptions by simulating potential attacks or misuse cases, including exploring edge cases, permission boundaries, and upgrade paths. ([https://dedaub.com/blog/web3-audit-methodology/](https://dedaub.com/blog/web3-audit-methodology/))

2.  Peer Review and Auditor Cross-Examination

Many audit teams, such as Dedaub,¬† incorporate an internal challenge mechanism where at least two senior researchers independently review the same codebase and then critique each other‚Äôs findings. This process surfaces blind spots and reinforces a deeper understanding. It also reduces the chance of one auditor overlooking critical logic flaws.

3.  Composability and Multilayered Thinking

Auditors must consider how different components of the protocol interact, not only within the contract but also across contract boundaries. For example, interactions with oracles, Automated Market Makers (AMMs), or third-party dependencies are reviewed to detect compositional risks. Vulnerabilities often emerge not from isolated code but from unintended interactions between modules.

4.  Static Analysis and Fuzz Testing

While human review remains central, auditors typically augment their process with automated tools. For example, the Dedaub Security Suite runs over 70 specialized analysis algorithms. These cover a range of detections including reentrancy risks, arithmetic overflows, unchecked calls, and unusual storage patterns ([https://www.alchemy.com/dapps/dedaub-contract-library/](https://www.alchemy.com/dapps/dedaub-contract-library)).

The tools used often include:

*   Static analysis to detect code smells or known anti-patterns ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDgeB--Lh6w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDgeB--Lh6w))¬†
*   Symbolic execution to model potential program states
*   Fuzzing to uncover crashes or unexpected behavior under randomized inputs¬†

Importantly, all automated results are manually reviewed by expert auditors. These tools serve to expand the inspection surface, but do not replace human reasoning or adversarial thinking.¬†

5.  Optimization and Ecosystem Compatibility

Beyond security, audits also assess performance-related issues such as gas inefficiencies. Contracts are reviewed for adherence to best practices in Solidity (or other applicable languages) and compatibility with widely-used infrastructure (e.g., ERC standards, layer-2 networks, upgradeable proxies).

6.  Reporting and Severity Classification

Findings are organized by severity (e.g., critical, high, medium, low, informational) with detailed explanations, reproduction steps, and remediation guidance. A good audit report communicates not only what‚Äôs wrong but why it matters, and what the potential impact could be if left unresolved.

Smart contract audits follow a rigorous, layered methodology:

*   Understand code behavior in depth
*   Model attacker scenarios
*   Use peer review to validate assumptions
*   Supplement with static tools and fuzzers
*   Review integrations and ecosystem alignment
*   Produce clear, prioritized findings

This process is designed to reduce the risk of on-chain exploits and ensure that contracts behave reliably under adversarial conditions.
